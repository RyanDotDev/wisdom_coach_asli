          Life coaching for kids is all about empowering kids through mindset development. Kids learn
          how to use the power of their mind and the power of their thoughts to create happiness,
          confidence, and success in their lives, so that they can take their life, goals, and dreams
          wherever they want to go.

    question: "How is life coaching different from counseling?",
    answer: (
      <>
        <p>
          Although life coaching and counseling may have similarities, such as asking the important
          questions, listening, and finding patterns in people&#39;s lives, they are not the same thing.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          Counseling is designed to help those with more serious issues lead a more normal, productive
          life or to get back on track – these types of issues might include anxiety, depression, or OCDs –
          moving past abuse or going through a personal crisis at home such as an illness or divorce.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          Life Coaching is different. It is about helping people get from where they are to where they want
          to be. For most people that means reaching higher goals and creating greater success,
          creating more balance and happiness in their lives, and feeling more fulfilled in their lives and in
          their relationships – it&#39;s about creating what they want.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          In many ways counseling is about resolving or managing issues from the past, whereas life
          coaching is about creating the future and helping clients achieve the ultimate vision they have
          for their lives.

        <p>
          Life coaching isn’t just for kids who are facing challenges or problems. Helping kids learn how
          to reach their fullest potential is about personal development and personal empowerment so
          that they will be ready to face any challenge that comes their way. The skills they learn can be
          used for the rest of their lives

          People often confuse parenting and “life coaching for kids”. Life coaching goes beyond the
          traditional parenting roles of moral and character development and it goes beyond learning how
          to treat others and learning how to behave.
